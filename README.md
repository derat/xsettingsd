# xsettingsd

xsettingsd is a daemon that implements the *XSETTINGS* specification.

It is intended to be small, fast, and minimally dependent on other
libraries. It can serve as an alternative to gnome-settings-daemon for
users who are not using the GNOME desktop environment but who still run
GTK+ applications and want to configure things such as themes, font
antialiasing/hinting, and UI sound effects.

## Installation

Requirements:

* C++ compiler
* [CMake] or [SCons]
* X11 headers (`libx11-dev` in Debian)
* GoogleTest (optional, `libgtest-dev` in Debian)

To compile and install using CMake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path ..
make
make install
```

To run tests:

```
make test
```

To delete all installed files:

```
make uninstall
```

Alternatively, you can compile `xsettingsd` and `dump_xsettings` using SCons:

```
sudo apt-get install scons g++ libstdc++-dev libx11-dev
scons xsettingsd dump_xsettings
```

[CMake]: https://cmake.org/
[SCons]: https://scons.org/

## Configuration

You may wish to dump your existing settings to use as a starting point. To do
this, check that `gnome-settings-daemon` (or another program that implements
XSETTINGS) is running and run the `dump_xsettings` program. Your current
settings should be printed to `stdout` in `xsettingsd`'s configuration format.
To use this as your initial configuration, redirect the output of the program:

```
dump_xsettings >~/.xsettingsd
```

At startup, xsettingsd reads its configuration from `$HOME/.xsettingsd` by
default. If it encounters any errors, it exits; otherwise it becomes the
XSETTINGS manager on all screens.

After modifying the `.xsettingsd` file, you can trigger a configuration reload
by sending a `HUP` signal to xsettingsd, e.g.

```
killall -HUP xsettingsd
```

If there in a problem with the new configuration, xsettingsd will continue using
the previous version.

The format for the configuration file is simple. Setting names and their
corresponding values are whitespace-separated, with at most one setting per
line.

*   Integer values appear as bare decimal numbers.
*   String values are double-quoted.
*   Color values are `(R, G, B, A)` or `(R, G, B)` tuples, where each value
    ranges between 0 and 65535 (omitting the alpha value results in full
    opacity).
*   Full-line comments can be started with a `#` character.

Here is an example `.xsettingsd` file:

```
# Configure our fonts.
Xft/Antialias 1
Xft/HintStyle "hintfull"
Xft/Hinting 1
Xft/RGBA "none"
Xft/lcdfilter "none"

# Create a color setting (haven't seen these used anywhere, though).
MyFavoriteColor (33667, 48059, 38036, 32768)  # not really my favorite!

EscapedQuote "here's how to put a \" in a string!"
```

## Running

If you are using a `~/.xsession` file to control which programs are executed
when you start an X session, you can add the following near the top of it:

```
/path/to/xsettingsd &
```

## Settings

The following table lists some of things that can be configured in GTK+
applications using XSETTINGS. The **Details** column lists the corresponding
properties in the [GtkSettings class].

## Other Notes

Some applications (e.g. Firefox 3) don't seem to use XSETTINGS to control text
rendering. You can try additionally putting something like the following in
`~/.fonts.conf`:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
  <match target="font" >
    <edit mode="assign" name="rgba">
      <const>none</const>
    </edit>
  </match>
  <match target="font" >
    <edit mode="assign" name="hinting">
      <bool>true</bool>
    </edit>
  </match>
  <match target="font" >
    <edit mode="assign" name="hintstyle">
      <const>hintfull</const>
    </edit>
  </match>
  <match target="font" >
    <edit mode="assign" name="antialias">
      <bool>true</bool>
    </edit>
  </match>
</fontconfig>
```

and in `~/.Xresources` or `~/.Xdefaults`:

```
Xft.antialias:          1
Xft.hinting:            1
Xft.rgba:               none
Xft.hintstyle:          hintfull
```

(Tweak the values to your own preferences, of course.)
